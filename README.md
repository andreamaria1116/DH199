### Project Description:
#### I want to create an application that delivers historical information about the LA film and telivision scene, using user’s location services and giving them alerts about films that have been shot in their location throughout history. User’s can filter the information by genre and decide how often they receive notifications. 
#### I moved to LA four years ago, and I’ve always been interested in learning about the city. Ever since my first visits to Los Angeles, I witnessed the Star Tours trucks carting groups of tourists around and showing them film landmarks. These tours are often expensive, inaccurate, or focused on a particular movie. When I was a tourist in LA, I myself wished there had been a user-friendly resource I could have accessed in order to receive historical information about my favorite films within the city that was accessible, cheap, and accurate. 
#### The biggest issue with current tools is that there is such a breadth of information spread over so many databases that finding desired information becomes difficult. Consolidating all these resources into one application would make accessing historical information easier and more enjoyable for users. Adding location services and the ability to filter information by interest would keep users from having to sift through huge amounts of information to find what’s relevant. If historical information was more accessible, customizable, and user friendly, more people would be interested in learning it. 
#### To complete this project, I will follow the user-centered design process, which involves conducting field and user research, doing a literature review of pre-existing sources, personas and usage scenarios, wireframing, low and high fidelity prototyping, and usability testing. I will employ the method of iterative design, in which user feedback is in a constant feedback loop with the design of my application. 

### Expected Outcome:
#### The outcome of my project will be web documentation of the design process, a high-fidelity prototype of the application, as well as a final research paper explaining the project.

# FilmLA: Literature Review

Film tourism is a popular form of tourism that evolved from the idea of hallmark events as tourist attractions, in which major events that normally have short exposure periods are used as a way to draw the attention of tourists to a location using their inimitability and timely significance. (Riley and Van Doren) Cinephiles travel to the locations where their favorite movies were filmed in an attempt to experience the emotions and visuals associated with the film over and over again. In “Repeating Visions: Hitchcock’s Vertigo and San Francisco,” Blackwood posits that locations are inherently changed in geographical space when they become a part of film history, and this change leads to a renewed attraction in the location. One city that has experienced this effect to a far greater extent than most others is the city of Los Angeles, which sees tons of visitors every year thanks to its rich and salient history in films. Although guided tours specializing on one particular film exist throughout the city, these tend to lack customizability, be costly, and be narrow in their scope. There is currently a lack of cost free, personal, and customizable resources for cinephiles touring the city of Los Angeles to utilize in order to educate themselves on the cinematic history of their surroundings.

Throughout recent years, the integration of technological tools in education has rapidly increased. Two emergent technologies that seem to be particularly useful in an educational context are augmented reality and location-based services. Augmented reality has been proven to improve learning performance, motivate users to want to learn, and encourage interaction and collaboration when implemented in learning environments. (Bacca) Although the implementation of location-based services has not been as extensively researched, its utilization in combination with augmented reality in the form of a smart phone application that teaches historical information of an area could help to increase engagement and user-friendliness. Through my project, I would like to research how location-based services, augmented reality, and user-centered design techniques can be utilized in order to efficiently and captivatingly deliver Los Angeles film history in real time for tourist consumption.
