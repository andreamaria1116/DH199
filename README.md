# FilmLA
## Andrea Mejia-Madriz

### Project Description:
#### I want to create an application that delivers historical information about the LA film scene, using user’s location services and giving them alerts about films that have been shot in their location throughout history. User’s can filter the information by genre and decide how often they receive notifications. 
#### I moved to LA four years ago, and I’ve always been interested in learning about the city. Since I didn’t learn the history of California in school like native Angelenos, I want to learn more about the city that I now call home in a simple and interactive way. Because LA is the hub of the film industry, I believe that having an application dedicated to delivering that information is incredibly helpful for tourists and locals alike. 
#### The biggest issue with current tools is that there is such a breadth of information spread over so many databases that finding desired information becomes difficult. Consolidating all these resources into one application would make accessing historical information easier and more enjoyable for users. Adding location services and the ability to filter information by interest would keep users from having to sift through huge amounts of information to find what’s relevant. If historical information was more accessible, customizable, and user friendly, more people would be interested in learning it. 
#### To complete this project, I will follow the user-centered design process, which involves conducting field and user research, doing a literature review of pre-existing sources, personas and usage scenarios, wireframing, low and high fidelity prototyping, and usability testing. I will employ the method of iterative design, in which user feedback is in a constant feedback loop with the design of my application. 

### Expected Outcome:
#### The outcome of my project will be web documentation of the design process, a high-fidelity prototype of the application, as well as a final research paper explaining the project.
